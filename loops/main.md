# Loops

Loops are used to execute a statement or a group of statements multiple times.

Ruby provides several different types of loops to handle looping requirements, the most common forms are the following:

- While Loops
A while loop repeats a statement or group of statements for a while, given a condition is true. It checks the condition before executing the loop block.

- For Loop
A for loop executes a sequence statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable

## Iterators

Iterators are methods that loop over a given set of data and allow you to operate on each element in the collection

- .each
.each is the method that works on collections such as arrays and hashes, then it begins executing the code within the block. The block's starting and ending points are defined by curly braces, so each time we iterate over the array, we need to assign elements of array to a variable. The definition of a variable is places between two pipes(||), after that, we can implement the logic.

## Do-While Loop

a do-while loop is similar to to the way that while loops work, the only difference is that the code within the loop gets executed at least one time, because the conditional check works after the code within the loop
